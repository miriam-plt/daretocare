        "details": ["The international art collective Dare to Care is coming to Helsinki with an unreleased exhibition about mental health and the Arts, accompanied by workshops and performances. During a week-long residency at Myymälä2 Gallery artists Miriam Poletti, Ania Duldiier and Cami Ruohonen will investigate the complex relationship between emotions, body and nature.", "Using macro images of the skin of her body, Poletti is creating sculpture-pillows. Through a workshop, she invites local artists to collectively explore the correlation between the mind, mental stress and the body, to create an object that reflects their unexpected connections. The work will be displayed in the end-of-residency exhibition.", "Duldiier’s performance “Rebirth” explores identity, culture shock, and adaptation as well as ways in which artists seek to establish connections and build relationships with new realities. She uses soil and moss as connection to the earth and the natural world, representing the process of rebirth, renewal, and transformation that occur when one immerses themselves in a new culture.", "Ruohonen’s series of paintings “Healing, touch and nature” investigates mindfulness and nature through the journey from darkness to light: suffering, dealing, seeking, healing. Before starting therapy, clear sky and greenery always helped her with anxiety and depression. Her abstract paintings Distilled memories are inspired by her skin’s recollection of nature.", "-", "Further information on the workshops and the residency programme will be announced on the Myymala2 Gallery website and on our channels.", "Project management, production, communication and curation by Elena Righini, Mathilde Palenius, Kristýna Ilek.", "The mobility project is funded by the European Union and implemented by the Goethe-Institut."]
