She will share her experiences with mental health issues in her artistic career and encourage the participants to explore theirs. The workshop will allow for an open and safe dialogue about working conditions in the arts and their impact on artists’ mental health. The first iteration of this creative research project was introduced in Helsinki in July 2023. The workshop is aimed for anyone working in the arts who would like to reflect on how their career affects their mental health.", "Workshop ‘A Thread of Empathy’ by Madeleina Kay offers participants a transformative experience centred on empathy and self-compassion through stitching. Participants are invited to reflect on past experiences that have caused and symbolically mend emotional wounds to connect with their core identity. Collaborative stitching fosters community and dialogue, culminating in a patchwork quilt, representing shared experiences and the healing power of empathy and connection. Through creative expression and collaboration, participants explore the journey towards self-compassion, resilience, and collective healing."]

This project creates a platform where artists dealing with diverse mental health conditions can showcase their work across a variety of venues throughout Europe. The exhibition features works selected by GAMIAN-Europe from an open call held in January 2024, showcasing the talents of artists from across Europe who have firsthand experiences with mental health issues.", "‘Ways of Healing’ was conceived as an exploration of the therapeutic value of art when addressing mental health issues and finding pathways to acceptance and healing through creativity. The public programme in DumBO and Adiacenze aims to foster an inclusive and thought-provoking environment where artists and the general public can engage in meaningful dialogue about mental health. Through showcasing artistic responses that destigmatise mental health issues, the exhibition encourages viewers to explore new avenues for personal growth, resilience, and emotional well-being.", "‘Ways of Healing’ is preceded by two workshops on 18th April from 18:00 in Adiacenze Art Space, facilitated by artists Kristýna Ilek and Madeleina Kay. You can sign up to the workshops here. The exhibition itself takes place in DumBO Officina from 19th April to 5th May 2024. The touring exhibition will be accompanied by a series of paintings by Cami Ruohonen ‘Healing, touch and nature’ which investigates mindfulness and nature through the journey from darkness to light: suffering, dealing, seeking, and healing. Before starting therapy, clear sky and greenery always helped Ruohonen with anxiety and depression. Furthermore, her abstract paintings ‘Distilled memories’ featured in the exhibition are inspired by her skin’s recollection of nature, while the most figurative pieces support abstract ideas with a surreal atmosphere. Through her work, she wants to remind everyone that nature is a resource of wellbeing, and that we are never alone with our struggles.", "At the opening on the 19th April from 18:30, you will have a chance to see Ania Duldiier’s performance ‘You’ll get used to it’ which delves into the daily reality of office life, with its curious dance between mundanity and absurdity. Each day unfolds as a subtle variation of the one before, amidst neverending chains of emails, meetings masquerading as productivity, and the monotonous rhythm of daily tasks. Tethered to a desk by the promise of a secure retirement, Duldiier illuminates the delicate balance between present sacrifices and the uncertain prospects of the future, prompting introspection on the true cost of working in the office. The performance is co-created with Tao Tao and Gabriela Marciniak.", "The exhibition is curated by Elena Righini, an independent curator and member of the Dare to Care Art Collective. Originally from Imola, Italy, Elena now resides in Spain but has established a strong connection with Bologna.", "-", "Curation by Elena Righini, project management, production and communication by Kristýna Ilek and Elena Righini.
