       "linktext": "This interview was originally published on Mental Health Europe Blog.",
       "intro": "My name is Kristýna Ilek, I am based in Prague, and as the group’s dramaturg I interviewed our producer Mathilde Palenius and curator Elena Righini who are also involved in the management of the project. Mathilde is currently responding from Finland and Elena from Italy.",
       "interview": [{
            "question": "Firstly, I would like to ask you both why did you decide to join the project? What made you think this was an important initiative to be a part of?",
            "person": "MP",
            "answer": "Initially, I joined the project through De Structura. During the Forum in Tallinn in July 2022, a few participants started talking about health issues they encountered in the context of professional artistic work. After that, Dare to Care – Art Collective emerged as a platform fuelled by the enthusiasm of its members and it is exciting to be working with artists from different backgrounds on the topic of mental health care on a European scale. Because the concept of ‘care’ is a buzzword nowadays, I like the challenge of looking for new ways of approaching it.",
            "person2": "ER",
            "answer2": "I started thinking about the issue of mental health of art professionals around a year ago during a course on cultural welfare as a part of my Master’s degree. It seemed like a big oxymoron to me – how can artists contribute to societal wellbeing while they suffer from precarious working conditions and mental health problems caused by occupational stress? This motivated me to join Dare to Care because I wanted to contribute to bringing a systemic change in rights of art workers and to improving the stability of careers in the art sector."
        },
        {
            "question": "There are many structural problems in the art world, such as funding transparency, nepotism, and expensive art education. However, you chose to focus on mental health care. I wonder if you have a personal experience with it and if there are any particular challenges you faced so far in your careers which led to problems relating to mental health?",
            "person": "MP",
            "answer": "I started my career as an artistic producer only a few years ago but I can already highlight some issues causing instability at work, such as the difficulty of finding a long-term contract, mainly because non-profit artistic associations do not have access to stable funding. It is also difficult to distinguish and track the number of paid working hours and volunteering which blurs the line between working and free time. This contributes to the overall precarious nature of my work and adds more pressure to my private life and my mental health.",
            "person2": "ER",
            "answer2": "For me the precarity and insecurity of working in the arts make me experience constant anxiety which is perpetuated by the difficulty of finding a paid job. I also feel like I am pressured to move and go abroad to build a portfolio. As a result, I have been suffering from panic attacks, migraines, and just overall poor health."
        },
        {
            "question": "You both mention precarity, unsustainability and instability. What kind of support is, in your opinion, missing at the moment in the art industry to prevent that?",
            "person": "MP",
            "answer": "Public funding should consider models which support long-term contracts for employees to alleviate precarity. It would be also great if artists could receive more training on, for example, budgeting, production, and management. Public services and funding bodies should learn more about the nature of creative work to understand the intricacies art professionals face. I also believe art professionals who have emotionally and physically strenuous work with an unstable working schedule would benefit from accessing support, perhaps through practical workshops which would teach them how to cope in such a working environment.",
            "person2": "ER",
            "answer2": "As independent and emerging artists, we definitely miss tailored funding opportunities. I would also like to see broader systemic or institutional support regarding mental health care for artists in general, with a focus on early career and emerging artists."
        },
        {
            "question": "My last question is about some of the goals of Dare to Care – what do you personally hope the collective will achieve?",
            "person": "ER",
            "answer": "Our goal is to be open to everyone who would like to join, to avoid exclusivity and competitiveness, which often contribute to artists’ struggle. I would like our collective to grow and bigger institutions to endorse our efforts to bring about real change. I think it is also important to identify what are currently the most urgent problems for artists.",
            "person2": "MP",
            "answer2": "I would firstly like our website to be a sustainable and trustworthy platform which would be a place for exchange, collecting testimonies and sharing efforts which would contribute to improvement of mental health conditions in the arts. I would also like us to develop cross-disciplinary practices in a dialogue with scientists to shed more light on mental health issues. Lastly, I would like to raise awareness about the working conditions in the arts beyond the field."

        "intro": "Kristýna Ilek from Dare to Care Art Collective interviewed members of Czech theatre group, Just Monkeys; Angelika Sbouli, Karolína Hýsková and Vendula Ježková, the organisers of ‘Mental hygiene for students of acting’ course. Just Monkeys is a group who focus on experimental theatre courses and workshops and community work.",
        "interview": [{
             "question": "Why did you decide to work together on the ‘Mental hygiene for students of acting’ course and why is mental hygiene important for you?",
             "person": "VJ",
             "answer": "Angelika initiated the collaboration and brought us together. During the covid pandemic, we spent hours of online discussions about our experiences in the acting industry. I believe that it is important for artists to be aware of the risks associated with the profession and to thrive not only in our professional lives but in our personal lives as well.",
             "person2": "KH",
             "answer2": "I graduated from the Music and Drama department at the Janáček Conservatoire in Ostrava and I felt that this subject was missing in my education. I lacked the methods of mental hygiene in my own acting practice. I sought individual therapy only when I experienced health and psychological problems, which is unnecessarily too late. When I met Angelika and Vendula, we agreed that there is not enough mental health care for acting students, so we created this programme.",
             "person3": "AS",
             "answer3": "We decided to collaborate because we consider this issue urgent. It is important for me personally, because I began studying acting at the Prague Conservatoire and later studied psychology. Only then did I understand what was happening at the conservatoire and how it negatively impacted my development. When you study at a conservatoire in the Czech Republic, you are between 14 and 18 years of age, which is a very sensitive, demanding, and crucial period."
         },
         {
             "question": "Why do you think studying acting is mentally challenging?",
             "person": "VJ",
             "answer": "Students in secondary schools, university-level art schools and academies are selected through talent exams. From my experience and observations, young people who exhibit heightened sensitivity and openness, which is often accompanied by vulnerability, are admitted. However, during their studies, they do not receive adequate support.",
             "person2": "AS",
             "answer2": "At the secondary level of art education, students are not at a developmental stage when they can meet the school's demands safely. Overwhelming students can lead to mental health difficulties.",
             "person3": "KH",
             "answer3": "It is demanding in many ways. Conservatoires are extremely time-consuming. The schedule is from morning till evening, often without a lunch break. The courses often do not address the immaturity of minors in creative subjects such as acting, artistic performance, etc. This can lead to, for example, addictive behaviour among students."
         },
         {
            "question": "What do students learn in the Mental hygiene course?",
            "person": "AS",
            "answer": "The most fundamental aspect of the course is raising students’ awareness about specificities of studying at a conservatoire and how it differs from studying at a general secondary school. We look for ways of studying acting safely. We put emphasis on one’s inner life, specific emotions that are important to be in touch with and techniques of decision-making and behaviour with regards to these emotions.",
            "person2": "KH",
            "answer2": "The course provides a theoretical understanding of humans as psycho-physio-socio-spiritual beings; we learn some general vocabulary from this context and conduct practical psycho-hygienic exercises with a focus on artistic work.",
            "person3": "VJ",
            "answer3": "I dedicate a part of the course to working on both group and individual mind maps. During the exercises, students focus on identifying what they consider necessary for achieving safety in their studies at the conservatoire. What works for one student might not be good for another and it is necessary for students to ask themselves: ‘What do I need to feel well?’ and take action accordingly. We also discuss the skills and abilities developed during the actors’ training and learn how to identify self-imposed demands when handling assignments and finding balance and boundaries."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why do you think such a course is necessary? Is mental hygiene not a part of the curriculum in art schools in the Czech Republic?",
            "person": "KH",
            "answer": "Mental hygiene is not included in any courses at art schools. From the feedback from students, we know that they really appreciate the focus of our course.",
            "person2": "AS",
            "answer2": "I am not aware of mental hygiene being formally included in the curriculum at art schools. I know that it is not practically implemented. Unfortunately, even teachers are not familiar with psycho-hygienic tools. I would compare the situation to intergenerational transmission of trauma. If I, as a teacher, was for instance humiliated and sexualised in the past, then I am likely to replicate similar behaviour with my students.",
            "person3": "VJ",
            "answer3": " I would like to expand on what Angelika said. Teachers at art schools are not only educators but also practitioners but they often lack pedagogical training. Art education in the Czech Republic is experiential, but supervision after rehearsals is not required. There is only the artist (the teacher) and their students in the room. There is no specific teaching methodology required, and the situation for teachers is very demanding; they are essentially on their own in the process. Furthermore, any support for teachers would need to be carefully considered and prepared so that they don't feel ‘under surveillance’. In our field, we are very sensitive to ‘art under surveillance’ due to our historical experience with censorship, which is present in art schools as well. Country-wide curricula no longer exist in the Czech Republic. Each school has its own individual educational programme."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why did you decide to work specifically with students from secondary art schools?",
            "person": "KH",
            "answer": "We perceive this group as the most vulnerable from a psychological standpoint",
            "person2": "AS",
            "answer2": "From our experience, in secondary art schools, students are not provided with any tools, support, and education about mental hygiene. As I mentioned, secondary art schools are very demanding for students and it is often impossible for them to fulfil the school’s requirements safely.",
            "person3": "VJ",
            "answer3": "For me, young students take responsibility for themselves and are attentive to their needs and boundaries. I am captivated by their sensitivity, and once they are given space, they flourish. They are much more respectful than my generation and are much more aware of their emotions."
        },
        {
            "question": "Based on your experience, what mental health issues do students struggle with the most? Can you identify the most common problem and what causes it?",
            "person": "KH",
            "answer": "Students often struggle with high levels of exhaustion, overwork, and an inability to consciously rest. This translates into their lives outside and after school.",
            "person2": "AS",
            "answer2": "They experience excessive psychological burden accompanied by intense time pressure. I have seen anxiety, emotional detachment, addictions, unhealthy coping strategies, and other issues.",
            "person3": "VJ",
            "answer3": "What scares me the most is the students’ low self-esteem and helplessness, which is very common. From my experience, this is caused by constantly comparing oneself to other actors and neglecting one’s own needs and boundaries while developing a character or a performance."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are your plans with ‘Mental hygiene for students of acting’ course?",
            "person": "KH",
            "answer": "Our goal is to integrate the course into the curriculum of Czech conservatoires. Until that happens, we will expand the course for other students from different years and other schools. There are countless topics to cover.",
            "person2": "AS",
            "answer2": "We currently do not have any external support so we are unsure exactly how this goal will materialise. Nevertheless, we are actively searching for ways to continue and we will not give up.",
            "person3": "VJ",
            "answer3": "I agree, we have this long-term vision. We are happy to see other initiatives in artists’ mental health, like Dare to Care. It is a great motivation for us to know that we are not alone in this. We wish you the best of luck."
